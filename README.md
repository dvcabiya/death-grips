This tracker gives an instant answer to the aforementioned question upon accessing the webpage, but also allows you to raise an issue if you believe the posted status to be incorrect, which will be reviewed and changed accordingly as soon as possible.

Death Grips is famous for being very reserved in giving out public information, so I hope that this site can be used as a concrete resource for busy fans to get their information. 

### Credits

I cloned the basic infrastructure from [MongoDB's MERN Stack Tutorial repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mern-stack-example), because I sometimes cannot be bothered to figure out what little bit of the stack I've gotten wrong for it all not to work. Thanks to them!
